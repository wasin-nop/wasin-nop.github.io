        <p>Bangkok is the capital and most populous city of Thailand, also known
            by its
            endonym Krung Thep Maha Nakhon or colloquially Krung Thep.</p>

        <ul><strong>Tourist Attractions in Bangkok</strong>
            <li> Wat Pho <p>One of Bangkok’s largest attractions,
                    the Wat Pho
                    temple houses the famous
                    Reclining Buddha, which measures a stunning 47 metres in
                    length. Therefore,
                    seeing it in person is surely the only way to appreciate its
                    sheer size.
                    Additionally, the 15-metre high statue is covered in gold
                    leaves, leaving
                    viewers in awe.

                    Besides the statue being the temple’s main attraction,
                    visitors will also find
                    the temple to be adorned with colourful murals. Moreover,
                    the temple has almost
                    400 Buddha images to see. If you spend a bit of time walking
                    around Wat Pho, you
                    will see that it features, what many call, is Thailand’s
                    best massage school.
                    Here, you can get a traditional Thai massage to unwind from
                    a visually exciting
                    day. After, you can plan to see the Grand Palace, as it is
                    only a 10-minute walk
                    from Wat Pho.</p><img src="./img/wat-pho.jpg" alt="wat pho"

                    Phra Nakhon Krung
                    Thep Maha Nakhon, 10200, Thailand.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Chatuchak Weekend Market <p>Chatuchak Weekend Market, also known
                    as JJ Market, is one of the world’s largest
                    outdoor markets. Here, your shopping dreams for something
                    bohemian can
                    definitely be fulfilled. From unique artworks to traditional
                    handicrafts,
                    Chatuchak has a diverse product collection. You can even
                    find gag gifts, such as
                    genitalia-shaped soaps and ashtrays.

                    However, as the market is crowded on the weekends, it is a
                    good idea to visit in
                    the morning. Moreover, the day’s first shoppers usually get
                    a good discount.
                    Remember, that quoted prices are a suggestion, as vendors
                    expect you to bargain
                    with them.</p> <img src="./img/Chatuchak Weekend Market.jpg"

            <li>The Grand Palace <p>What can be more exciting than seeing The
                    Grand Palace in Thailand’s capital?
                    Here, just seeing it from the streets won’t cut it, even
                    though the white walls
                    hiding its priceless contents are quite beautiful. Once
                    paying for a ticket,
                    visitors will be granted entry into a magical attraction,
                    full of stunning
                    temples spread across the property. Thus, it can be said
                    that a visit to Bangkok
                    is never complete without seeing the Palace.

                    One of the most famous temples inside of the walls is that
                    of Wat Phra Kaew, or
                    the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. Inside, you can see an
                    emerald and gold
                    adorned Buddha wearing a cloak that is changed by the King,
                    with each new
                    season. At night, the Grand Palace lights up the Bangkok
                    skyline, making it a
                    spectacular scene with many opportunities for an enchanting
                    photo op.</p><img src="./img/The Grand Palace.png"

            <li>Jim Thompson House Museum <p>The Jim Thompson House Museum is
                    undoubtedly one of the most interesting sights
                    in Thailand’s capital. As its history includes being part of
                    the silk trade’s
                    revival, shopping at Jim Thompson is unrivalled. However,
                    despite his efforts to
                    showcase Thai silk, Thompson mysteriously went missing while
                    in Malaysia, back
                    in 1967. He was never found again.

                    The museum has dedicated a part of it towards exploring the
                    many theories about
                    how he went missing. Regardless, the museum’s impressive
                    showcase of unique and
                    expensive relics may just be one of the most beautiful
                    displays of Thailand’s
                    rich culture.</p><img

                    Thep Maha Nakhon,

            <li>Khao San Road <p>For backpackers, a trip to Bangkok starts at
                    Khao San Road. Known as a place to
                    stop off, enjoy the crazy night scene, and meet fellow
                    travellers, this road has
                    some epic stories coming out of it. The road is 1 km long
                    and is filled with
                    street food vendors, bars, chain restaurants, and bar girls.

                    They say you can find anything on Khao San Road, including
                    fried scorpions and
                    other insects in which to try. But, don’t worry, they all
                    taste like chicken!
                    After you try a bite, you can wash it down with a bucket of
                    jungle juice. As the
                    scene can get quite crowded at night, most bars extend
                    chairs out into the road
                    to offer more seating for people. Alas, nothing is more
                    famous for backpackers
                    stopping off at The Big Mango, than Khao San!</p><img

    <h3>What is “WAGYU A5” ?</h3>
    <p>Wagyu beef—you know, the transcendently tender, fatty, umami-rich
        steak—has
        become as synonymous with luxury as caviar or black truffles. But no
        matter how
        many Michelin-starred menus this delicacy graces, all of the facts about
        Wagyu
        steak still tend to elude even the most seasoned diners. </p>
